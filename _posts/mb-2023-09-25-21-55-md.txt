I use ChatGPT frequently but I recently noticed that I almost always say “please” when making a request. It’s subconscious; I don’t even realize I do it. 

I know it’s not a person and “feels” nothing but even since I noticed it, I still can’t bring myself to omit the adverb. It seems wrong but I can’t explain why. There’s no logical reason to “be polite” to a machine but choosing not to still feels inappropriate.
